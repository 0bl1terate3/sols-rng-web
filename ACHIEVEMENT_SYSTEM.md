## Achievements NOT Implemented

The following achievements from Sol's RNG are not implemented due to missing game systems:

1. **Daily Quest Achievements** - No daily quest system
2. **Biome Achievement (Dreamspace)** - Would need event tracking
3. **Developer-related Achievements** (Sol, Red Moon, Mastermind, etc.) - Require special auras/events
4. **Quest Board Achievements** - Different quest system than current
5. **Social Achievements** (Friends, etc.) - No multiplayer
6. **Special Event Achievements** (Easter egg, Lime's questline, etc.) - No event system
7. **Jester Trade** - No trading system
8. **Money/Currency Achievements** - No money system (ready for future)
9. **Limbo Achievement** - Would need Limbo dimension event tracking
10. **Eden Achievement** - No Eden aura in current auraData

## Integration Points

### When Rolling Auras
```javascript
// In completeRollWithAura()
trackAuraRarity(aura.rarity);
if (aura.breakthrough) {
    trackBreakthrough();
}
checkAchievements();
```

### When Using Potions
```javascript
// In usePotion()
for (let i = 0; i < amount; i++) {
    trackPotionUse();
}
```

### Automatic Tracking
- Playtime updates every 60 seconds via `setInterval`
- Roll count tracked in `getActualRolledAura()`
- Persistent storage in localStorage

## Rewards System

### Implemented Rewards
- **Potions**: Automatically added to inventory
- **Items**: Automatically added to inventory (Void Coins, Random Rune Chests, etc.)
- **Money**: Logged (system ready for future currency implementation)
- **Buffs**: Logged (system ready for future buff implementation)

### Future Enhancement Ideas
- Currency system to spend achievement money
- Buff system for achievement milestone bonuses
- Achievement point system
- Leaderboard titles
- Achievement sound effects
- More detailed achievement statistics
