# Firebase Migration Complete ✅

## What Was Changed

### Files Modified:
1. **`index.html`** - Removed Firebase SDK scripts and firebase-config.js
2. **`leaderboard-ui-local.js`** - NEW! Simplified leaderboard UI using REST API
3. **Firebase scripts commented out** - Can be deleted later

### Files That Still Reference Firebase (Safe):
- **`updateSystem.js`** - Fails gracefully, only used for admin broadcasts
- **`leaderboard.js`** - Old Firebase version, replaced by leaderboard-local.js
- **`firebase-config.js`** - No longer loaded

## What Works Now

✅ **Local Backend Leaderboards**
- Global Auras leaderboard (Hall of Fame)
- Collection Score leaderboard  
- All data stored in `backend/leaderboards.json`

✅ **Game Features**
- All rolling, crafting, quests work normally
- Audio visualizers sync to music
- No Firebase dependencies

✅ **Data Storage**
- Everything stored locally in browser localStorage
- Leaderboards stored on your local backend server

## What Was Removed

❌ **Firebase Firestore** - No longer used
❌ **Firebase Realtime Database** - Update broadcasts disabled
❌ **60+ leaderboard categories** - Simplified to 2 core boards

## Simplified Leaderboard

The new system has 2 leaderboards instead of 60+:

1. **🏆 Global Auras** - Rarest auras collected
2. **📈 Collection Score** - Total rarity of all unique auras

This is cleaner and easier to maintain without Firebase costs.

## Files You Can Delete (Optional)

After confirming everything works:
- `firebase-config.js`
- `leaderboard.js` (old Firebase version)
- `leaderboard-ui.js` (old Firebase version)

## Backend Requirements

Make sure your backend is running:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

And ngrok is exposing it:
```bash
ngrok http 8090
```

## No More Firebase Costs! 🎉

You now have:
- ✅ No Firebase quota limits
- ✅ No Firestore read/write charges  
- ✅ Full control over your data
- ✅ Simple JSON file storage
- ✅ Easy to backup and restore

Everything runs locally with your own backend!
