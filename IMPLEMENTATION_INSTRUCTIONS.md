# ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR 221 MISSING ACHIEVEMENTS

## **Overview**
This guide shows how to implement all 221 missing achievement types in 4 stages.

---

## **STAGE 1: Add Tracking Variables**
**File:** `STAGE1_TRACKING_VARIABLES.js`

**Where to add:**
- Open `gameLogic.js`
- Find the gameState object (around line 4078)
- Navigate to `achievements.stats` section
- Add all variables from STAGE1 file after `rollsSinceCommon: 0`

**What it does:**
- Adds 200+ new tracking variables to store achievement progress
- Initializes counters, flags, arrays, and objects for all achievement types

---

## **STAGE 2: Add Case Statements**
**File:** `STAGE2_CASE_STATEMENTS.js`

**Where to add:**
- Open `gameLogic.js`
- Find the `checkAchievements()` function (around line 4377)
- Navigate to the switch statement
- Add all case statements from STAGE2 file BEFORE the closing `}` of the switch

**What it does:**
- Adds 221 new case statements to check if achievements are unlocked
- Links achievement types to their tracking variables

---

## **STAGE 3: Add Helper Functions**
**File:** `STAGE3_HELPER_FUNCTIONS.js`

**Where to add:**
- Open `gameLogic.js`
- Find the area BEFORE `checkAchievements()` function (around line 4240)
- Add all helper functions from STAGE3 file

**What it does:**
- Adds helper functions to track deletions, merchant purchases, currency, potions, gears, biomes
- Provides utilities for complex achievement checking

---

## **STAGE 4: Integrate Tracking Logic** (TO BE CREATED)

**What needs to be done:**
1. Call tracking functions during gameplay events:
   - When aura is rolled â†’ track patterns, luck, rarity
   - When aura is deleted â†’ call `trackDeletion()`
   - When merchant purchase â†’ call `trackMerchantPurchase()`
   - When currency changes â†’ call `trackCurrencyChange()`
   - When potion effect triggers â†’ call `trackPotionEffect()`
   - When gear effect triggers â†’ call `trackGearEffect()`
   - When biome changes â†’ call `trackBiomeVisit()`

2. Add tracking to existing functions:
   - `completeRollWithAura()` - main roll tracking
   - `usePotion()` - potion tracking
   - `equipGear()` - gear tracking
   - `craftItem()` - crafting tracking
   - `deleteAura()` - deletion tracking (if exists)

3. Create new tracking intervals for:
   - Hourly roll tracking
   - Daily stat resets
   - Session management
   - Weekly tracking

## **Additional Files Needed:**

### **loadGameState() Initialization**
Similar to existing Rolling Specialist initialization (lines 5372-5410), add:
```javascript
// Initialize Stage 1 variables for old saves
if (stats.exoticDeletes === undefined) stats.exoticDeletes = 0;
if (stats.commonsDeleted === undefined) stats.commonsDeleted = 0;
// ... repeat for all 200+ variables
```

---

## **Testing Checklist:**

After implementation, test:
- âœ… Deletion achievements (delete auras, check counters)
- âœ… Biome achievements (visit biomes, check counts)
- âœ… Luck achievements (roll with different luck levels)
- âœ… Merchant achievements (buy from merchants)
- âœ… Currency achievements (gain/spend money, void coins)
- âœ… Potion achievements (use special potions)
- âœ… Streak achievements (test consecutive patterns)
- âœ… Collection achievements (collect specific auras)
- âœ… Ultimate achievements (reach extreme milestones)

---

## **Estimated Implementation Time:**

- Stage 1 (Variables): **5 minutes** - Copy/paste
- Stage 2 (Cases): **10 minutes** - Copy/paste  
- Stage 3 (Helpers): **5 minutes** - Copy/paste
- Stage 4 (Logic): **2-4 hours** - Requires careful integration
- Testing: **2-3 hours** - Verify all types work
- **Total: 4-7 hours**

---

## **Priority Order:**

If doing in phases:

**Phase 1 (Easy):** Deletion, Currency, Merchants - Simple counters
**Phase 2 (Medium):** Biomes, Potions, Gears - Event-based tracking
**Phase 3 (Hard):** Luck patterns, Streaks, Collections - Complex logic
**Phase 4 (Very Hard):** Ultimate, Special combos - Advanced conditions
