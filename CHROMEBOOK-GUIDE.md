### **Method 2: Local Testing on Chromebook**

## 🧪 Testing PWA Features:

### **Check if PWA is working:**

1. Open your game in Chrome
2. Press `F12` (Dev Tools)
3. Go to **Application** tab
4. Check:
   - ✅ **Manifest** - Should show your game info
   - ✅ **Service Workers** - Should be "activated and running"
   - ✅ **Cache Storage** - Should have cached files

### **Test offline mode:**

1. Open game in Chrome
2. Load it once (let it cache)
3. Turn off internet / disconnect WiFi
4. Refresh page - **game should still work!**
