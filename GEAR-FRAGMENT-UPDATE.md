## Why This Matters

### Expedition Loop
1. Run expeditions → get Gear Fragments
2. Collect 3-15 fragments
3. Craft expedition-focused gear
4. Better gear → higher expedition success
5. More successful expeditions → more fragments
6. Repeat, building toward Veteran's Sigil

### Gear Fragment Value
- **T2**: 3-4 fragments (starter expedition gear)
- **T3**: 6-7 fragments (mid-game power spike)
- **T4**: 8-10 fragments (serious explorer gear)
- **T5**: 15 fragments (endgame expedition mastery)

### Special Benefits
- **Expedition Success Rate**: +10% (Expedition Bracer)
- **Expedition Rewards**: +15% (Wayfarer), +25% (Veteran's Sigil)
- **Double Loot Chance**: +5% (Salvaged Ring)
- **Growing Power**: +50% max luck growth (Reconstructed Core)

## How to Use

1. **Start expeditions** via expedition system
2. **Collect Gear Fragments** from rewards (1-5 per expedition)
3. **Check Crafting tab** - new recipes available
4. **Craft expedition gear** starting with T2 bracers
5. **Higher success rates** = more fragments = better gear
6. **Endgame goal**: Craft Veteran's Sigil (T5, 15 fragments)

## Fragment Economy

Gear Fragments now have **clear progression path**:
- Farm early: 3-4 fragments → T2 starter gear
- Mid-game: 6-7 fragments → T3 growing power
- Late-game: 8-10 fragments → T4 expedition bonuses
- Endgame: 15 fragments → T5 ultimate explorer gear

**Fragments are no longer useless!**
